=== Header row

The first row of a table can be rendered as a header row with the `header` value.
The header value is assigned by setting the `options` attribute or based on the table's layout.

The `options` attribute is set in the table's attribute list and assigned the value `header` in the example below.

.Table with the header value assigned to the options attribute
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=opt-h]
----

.Result: Rendered table when the header value is assigned to the options attribute
[width=90]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=opt-h]

Alternatively, you can define the header row based on how you layout the table.
Asciidoctor use the following conventions to determine when the first row should become the header row:

. The first line of content inside the table block delimiters is not empty.
. The second line of content inside the table block delimiters is empty.
. The `options` attribute has not been specified in the block attributes.

As seen in the result of the example below, if all of these rules hold, then the first row of the table is treated as a header.

.Table that has an implicit header row
[source]
----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]
----

.Result: Rendered table when the header row was assigned implicitly
[width=90]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]

Notice that when the implicit method of assigning the header row is used, it is not necessary to set the `cols` attribute.

CAUTION: We're considering using a similar convention for enabling the footer in the future.
Thus, if you rely on this convention to enable the header row, it's advised that you not put all the cells in the last row on the same line unless you intend on making it the footer row.

=== Footer row

The last row of a table can be styled as a footer by assigning the `footer` value to the `options` attribute.

----
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=opt-f]
----

.Result: Table rendered with a footer
[width=90]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=opt-f]

TIP: Remember that when the options attribute is set, and you want the first row of the table to be displayed as a header, you must assign the header value.

=== Table width

By default, a table will stretch to fit the width of the page.
To reduce the width of the table, set the `width` attribute in the table's attribute list.
The width is a percentage value ranging from 0 to 100.
The `%` sign is optional.

.Table with width set to 65%
----
[width=65]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with a width of 65%
[width=65]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

=== Table borders

The borders on a table are controlled using the `frame` and `grid` attributes.
You can combine these two attributes to achieve a variety of border styles for your tables.

==== Frame

The border around a table is controlled using the `frame` attribute.
By default, the frame attribute is assigned the `all` value, which draws a border on each side of the table.
If you set the frame attribute, you can override the default value with the values `topbot`, `sides` or `none`.

The `topbot` value draws a border on the top and bottom of the table.

----
[frame=topbot]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with frame=topbot
[width=90, frame=topbot]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

The `sides` value draws a border on the right and left side of the table.

----
[frame=sides]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with frame=sides
[width=90, frame=sides]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

The `none` value removes the borders around the table.

----
[frame=none]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with frame=none
[width=90, frame=none]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

==== Grid

The borders between the cells in a table are controlled using the `grid` attribute.
By default, the grid attribute is assigned the `all` value, which draws a border between all cells.
If you set the `grid` attribute, you can override the default value with the values `rows`, `cols` or `none`.

The `rows` value draws a border between the rows of the table.

----
[grid=rows]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with grid=rows
[width=90, grid=rows]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

The `cols` value draws borders between the columns.

----
[grid=cols]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with grid=cols
[width=90, grid=cols]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

The `none` value removes all borders between the cells.

----
[grid=none]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with grid=none
[width=90, grid=none]
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=base-h]

:table-caption: Table
=== Table caption

If you specify a title on a table, the title will be used as part of the table's caption.
Adding a title also designates the table as a [.term]_formal table_.

By default, the title of a formal table is prefixed with the label `Table <n>.` followed by a space, where `<n>` is the 1-based index of all formal tables in the document.

----
.A formal table
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with a title
[width=90]
.A table with a title
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]

You can customize the caption label by specifying the `caption` attribute.
If you want a space between the label and the title, you must add a trailing space to the value of the caption attribute.
(Don't let the name of the attribute mislead you.
The caption attribute only sets the caption's label, not the whole caption line).

----
[caption="Table A. "]
.A formal table
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with a title and custom label
[width=90, caption="Table A. "]
.A formal table
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]

If you want to exclude the caption label altogether, simply assign a blank value to the `caption` attribute.

----
[caption=]
.A formal table
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]
----

.Result: Table rendered with a title and no label
[width=90, caption=]
.A formal table
include::ex-table.adoc[tags=impl-h]

:table-caption!:

Alternatively, you can disable the caption label for tables globally by undefining the `table-caption` document attribute.

//NOTE: At this time, Asciidoctor has not implemented the `align`, `halign`, or `valign` attributes.
