Syntax to cover:
- break up attributes and substitutions?
- block metadata (attributes, id, role, etc)
- index terms
- commandline reference? perhaps another doc?
////

This guide provides an index of the common document attributes and formatting elements used when writing with AsciiDoc syntax.
AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.

[NOTE]
====
Several of the examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
Equivalent output is generated when using the DocBook backend.
====

== Paragraphs

.Normal
----
In AsciiDoc, a paragraph doesn't require any special markup.

To start a new paragraph, just leave a blank line and continue typing.
Adjacent lines, like these, are joined together as a single paragraph.
----

.Literal
----
  A line that begins with one or more spaces is a literal paragraph.
  Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
  Endlines are preserved.
----

TIP: Use one or two spaces to offset a literal paragraph, but no more.
*Be frugal!*

.Admonition
----
NOTE: A paragraph that begins with a label is an admonition, such as a tip,
note, warning or important information. An admonition paragraph is set apart
from the main content and displayed next to a matching label or icon.
----

NOTE: Here's a preview of an admonition paragraph.
You can also create admonition blocks, which are covered later.

== Formatted Text

.Emphasis
----
*bold phrase*

**b**old le**tt**ers

_italic phrase_ (preferred)
'italic phrase'

__i__talic le__tt__ers

*_bold italic phrase_*

+monospaced phrase+

++m++onospaced le++tt++ers

+*monospace bold phrase*+

+_monospace italic phrase_+

[big]#phrase styled by CSS class .big#

[big]##O##nce upon a time...
----

.Superiors and inferiors
----
^superscript phrase^

e = mc^2^

~subscript phrase~

H~2~O
----

.Quotes
----
`single smart quotes'

``double smart quotes''
----

== Document Header

.Title only
----

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.

[[section_titles]]
== Section Titles (HTML Headers)

.Article Doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)
== Section Level 1
=== Section Level 2
==== Section Level 3
===== Section Level 4
----

WARNING: In the Article Doctype there can be only one Document Title (Level 0), which is the text provided in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an +<h2>+ heading.

.Book Doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)
== Section Level 1
=== Section Level 2
==== Section Level 3
===== Section Level 4
= Section Level 0
----

.Custom id
----
[[primitives-nulls]]
== Primitive types and null values
----

IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember and maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?
*Be frugal!*

== Include Files

.Document parts
----

== Lists

.Unordered, basic
----
- Apples
- Oranges
- Bananas

//

* Apples
* Oranges
* Bananas
----

NOTE: Blank lines are required before and after a list and are permitted, but not required, between list items.

TIP: You can force two lists apart with a line comment, as the previous example demonstrates.

.Unordered, nested
----
* Apples
** Corland
** Rome

----

.Complex content in outline lists
----
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content.
That paragraph may be wrapped across multiple lines.
+
Any additional paragraph or block is attached with an adjacent list continuation.
+
____
A list continuation is a plus sign on a line by itself.
____

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ gem install asciidoctor

* AsciiDoc lists can contain lots of complex content.

.Enabling the syntax highlighter
[NOTE]
====
Syntax highlighting is enabled by setting the +source-highlighter+ attribute in the document header or supplied as an argument.

 :source-highlighter: pygments

The valid options for each implementation are as follows:

AsciiDoc:: pygments, source-highlighter, highlight (default)
Asciidoctor:: coderay, highlightjs (and growing!)

.AsciiDoc history
****
AsciiDoc was first released in Nov 2002 by Stuart Rackham.
It was designed from the start to be a shorthand syntax
for producing professional documents like DocBook and LaTeX.
****
----

NOTE: Any block can have a title, positioned above the block.
A block title is a line of text that starts with a dot.
The dot cannot be followed by a space.

.Example

[NOTE]
====
An admonition block may contain complex content.

[quote, Albert Einstein]
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

____

on this continent a new nation...
____
----

.Passthrough
----
++++
Content in a passthrough block is passed to the output unprocessed.
That means you can include raw HTML, like this video tag:

<video poster="images/movie-reel.png">
  <source src="videos/writing-zen.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

It's also useful for embedding content, like a Gist:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/example/123456.js"></script>
++++
----

.Open
----
--
An open block can be an anonymous container,
or it can masquerade as any other block.
--

[source]
--
puts "I'm a source block!"
--
----

== Comments

.Single line
----
// A single-line comment.
----

TIP: Single-line comments can be used to divide elements, such as two adjacent lists.

.Multi-line
----
////
A multi-line comment.

Notice it's a delimited block.
