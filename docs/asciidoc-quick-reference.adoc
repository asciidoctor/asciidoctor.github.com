Syntax to cover:
- preface
- index terms
- built-in attributes (such as {author}, {revision}, etc)
- start=n for ordered lists
- horizontal labeled list
- anchor for any block element

- break up attributes and substitutions?
- block metadata (attributes, id, role, etc)
- commandline reference? perhaps another doc? yes

PDF TODO:
- add license on title page (legalnotice tag)
- table cell bg
- show example of section levels
- syntax highlight ruby code (requires switch to https://code.google.com/p/java-syntax-highlighter)
- style sidebar block

== About
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.
{description}

NOTE: Several of the examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating DocBook.

== Paragraphs

.Normal
----
Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.
Consecutive lines of text are joined to form a single paragraph.

====

.Line breaks
----
To make a line break, end the line in a space followed by a plus. +
This results in a visible line break (e.g., <br>) between the lines.

Rubies are red. +
Sapphires are blue.

.Literal
----
A normal paragraph.

 A line that begins with one or more spaces is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
 The text is shown in a fixed-width font
 and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

TIP: Use one or two spaces to offset a literal paragraph, but no more.
*Be frugal!*

.Admonition
----
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information. Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph. The admonition is set apart
from the main content and displayed next to its label or
corresponding icon.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

WARNING: When using the article doctype (the default), you can only have one level-0 section title (i.e., the document title) and it must be in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an +<h2>+ heading.

====

IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember, hard to maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?

As a tip of the hat to Dick, Asciidoctor recognizes text between "air quotes" as a quote block.
Air quotes are the best thing since fenced code blocks.
