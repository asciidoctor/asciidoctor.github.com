= Environment Attributes

Asciidoctor automatically assigns values to various document attributes whenever a document is loaded or converted.
These attributes, termed [.term]_environment attributes_, provide information about the runtime environment, such as how, where and when the document is being processed.
Like other document attributes, environment attributes can be referenced whereever attribute references are permitted.
It's recommended that you treat these attributes as read only.
