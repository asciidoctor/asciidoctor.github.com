=== Left or right column layout
// tag::column[]
For html only, the TOC can be positioned in a column to the left or right of the document's content by assigning the `left` or `right` value to the `toc` attribute.
The column is scrollable and fixed.

=== Manual placement
// tag::place[]
`toc` values of `auto`, `preamble`, and `macro` allow the TOC to appear in the main document area.

When `toc` is blank or set to `auto`, the TOC is inserted directly below the documentâ€™s title and author.

When `toc` is set to `preamble`, the TOC is placed immediately below the preamble.
It will not appear if your document does not have a preamble.

To place the TOC anywhere else, set the `toc` attribute to `macro`.
Then, put the `+toc::[]+` block macro where you want the TOC to appear.

If `toc` is not set to `macro`, any `+toc::[]+` macros will be ignored.
The `+toc::[]+` macro should appear at most once in any document.

<1> The toc attribute must be set to macro in order to enable the use of the `toc::[]` macro.
<2> In this example, the `toc::[]` macro is placed below the first section's title, indicating that this is the location where the TOC will be displayed once the document is rendered.
