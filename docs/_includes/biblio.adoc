Simple bibliographies can be created out of unordered lists in a section that carries the `bibliography` style.
When the `bibliography` style is set on the enclosing section, the `bibliography` style on each unordered list in the that section is implied.
Cross references to bibliography entries are rendered as [<label>], where <label> is the xreflabel, if specified, or the ID if not.

Example:

.Bibliography with inbound references
----
include::ex-biblio.adoc[tags=base]
----

Renders as:

|===
a|
include::ex-biblio.adoc[tags=base]
|===

WARNING: If the bibliography style is used on an unordered list outside of a bibliography section, the resulting behavior is unspecified.

If you want more advanced features such as auto-numbering and selectable citation styles, try the {uri-org}/asciidoctor-bibtex[asciidoctor-bibtex] project.
