//= Sizing an image

To control the image size, you should provide a separate attribute for each output:

----
image::flower.jpg[width="300",pdfwidth="50%",scaledwidth="50%"]
----

NOTE: Images always keep their original aspect ratio, so it is only necessary to specify the width.

`width` is for html, and specifies the image size in CSS pixels (1/96 of an inch, but see https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/embedded-content-0.html#dimension-attributes).
Using the default stylesheet, `width` is obeyed unless the image would exceed the content width or height, in which case it is scaled to fit ("responsive scaling").

`pdfwidth` is for pdf (see https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf#image-scaling).
It accepts these units:

[horizontal]

cm:: Centimeter
	
in:: Inches

mm:: Millimeter

%:: Percentage of width between the current indents

vw:: Percentage of the page width, ignoring margins

vh:: Percentage of the page height, ignoring margins

pt (or none):: Points (1/72 of an inch)

If `pdfwidth` is not provided, pdf also accepts `scaledwidth` (no units, assumed to be %), or `width` (no units, assumed to be pixels), in that order.

`scaledwidth` is for DocBook, and sizes the image as a percentage of the width between the current indents.
DocBook also accepts the `width` attribute if `scaledwidth` is not provided.
The value of `width` when used with DocBook can have the following units:

[horizontal]

px (or none):: Output device pixels (normally 300 dpi)

pt:: Points (1/72 of an inch)

cm::   Centimeters

mm::   Millimeters

pc::   Picas (1/6 of an inch)

in::   Inches

em::   Ems (current font size)

%::    Percentage of intrinsic image size

Putting it together:

.Image sizing methods
[cols="<10,<15,<15,<15,<15",options="header,unbreakable"]
|====
|Output |Absolute size |Relative to original image size |Relative to "margins" |Relative to "page"

|html
|width="120"
|Not possible
|width="50%"
|N/A

|pdf
|pdfwidth="100mm" 

(or cm, in, pt)
|Not possible
|pdfwidth="80%"
|pdfwidth="50vw" 

(or vh)

|DocBook
|width="100mm" 

(or cm, em in, pc, pt, px) 
|width="80%
|scaledwidth="50%"
|Not possible

|====


A practice you should consider is to use attributes to set the values for each output:

	ifdef::backend-html5[]
	:twoinches: width='144'
	:full-width: width='100%'
	:half-width: width='50%'
	:half-size:
	:thumbnail: width='60'
	endif::[]
	ifdef::backend-pdf[]
	:twoinches: pdfwidth='2in'
	:full-width: pdfwidth='100vw'
	:half-width: pdfwidth='50vw'
	:half-size: pdfwidth='50%'
	:thumbnail: pdfwidth='20mm'
	endif::[]
	ifdef::backend-docbook5[]
	:twoinches: width='50mm'
	:full-width: scaledwidth='100%'
	:half-width: scaledwidth='50%'
	:half-size: width='50%'
	:thumbnail: width='20mm'
	endif::[]

Then specify your images as:

----
image::image.jpg[{half-size}]
----

etc.

As well as providing consistency across your document, this will help insulate you from future changes (http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Unit-of-measure-for-image-dimensions-td3040.html#a3222 for example).
