Extensions have proven to be central to the success of AsciiDoc and the Python implementation.
Despite the success they've enjoyed, there's still _plenty_ of room for improvement.

Extensions in AsciiDoc (technically called filters) have a number of problems:

* they are challenging to write because they work at such a low-level (read as: nasty regular expressions)
* they are fragile since they rely on system commands to do anything significant
* they are hard to distribute due to the lack of integration with a formal distribution system

The goal for Asciidoctor has always been to allow extensions to be written using the full power of a programming language (whether it be Ruby, Java, Groovy or JavaScript), similar to what we've done with the backend (rendering) mechanism.
That way, you don't have to shave yaks to get the functionality you want, and you can distribute the extension using defacto-standard packaging mechanisms (like RubyGems or JARs).
