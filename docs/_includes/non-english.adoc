== Using Asciidoctor with non-English Languages

Asciidoctor understands UTF-8 character sets so you can write documents in any language that your editor supports, with some caveats:

* The Asciidococtor html and pdf backends only support left-to-right and top-to-bottom reading; if you want other styles you need to use a Docbook tool chain.
* Attributes that generate dates and times are not localised; they will always return strings localised to EN-GB.
* You need to take special action to translate automatically generated labels (see below).

=== Docbook
Set the `lang` attribute to the appropriate language (it defaults to en (English)). 
This will ensure that all labels are output in the specified language.
For example:

----
$ asciidoctor -a lang=es doc/article.txt
----

Additional language considerations for Docbook are described in link:http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/Localizations.html[DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide].

=== Asciidoctor
If you are using the Asciidoctor html or pdf backends, you need to translate the various captions yourself by setting attributes:

[cols="10,20,10",width="80%"]

|caution-caption

=== Translation
Asciidoctor (or Docbook) currently does not support translation.
There is a proposal to integrate gettext (link:http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Professional-providers-translating-Asciidoc-tt2692.html#none[discussion]), but all suggestions are welcome.
