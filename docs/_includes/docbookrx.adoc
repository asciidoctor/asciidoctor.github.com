- user-manual: Convert DocBook 5 to Asciidoctor
////

One of the things Asciidoctor excels at is converting AsciiDoc source into valid and well-formed DocBook 5 XML content.

What if you're in the position where you need to go the other way: migrate all your legacy DocBook 5 XML content to AsciiDoc?
The prescription (℞) you need to get rid of your DocBook pains could be DocBook℞, which is hosted at https://github.com/opendevise/docbookrx.

DocBookRx is the start of a DocBook to AsciiDoc converter written in Ruby.
This converter is far from perfect at the moment, and some of the conversion is done hastily.

The plan is to evolve it into a robust library for performing this conversion in a reliable way.
You can read more about this initiative in the linked repository.

The best thing for this tool is active users putting it through its paces.
The more advanced the DocBook XML converted by the tool, the better the tool will become.
