=== Escaping the Cell Separator

The parser scans for the cell separator to divide the cells _before_ it processes the cell text (no matter what that text contains, even passthroughs).
If your content includes the cell separator, you must escape that character using a leading backslash.
Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a cell separator.
The backslash will be removed from the converted output.

Consider the following example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols=2*]
|====
|The default separator in PSV tables is the \| character.
|The \| character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====
----

This table will render as follows:

.Result: Converted PSV table that contains pipe characters
[cols=2*]
|====
|The default separator in PSV tables is the \| character.
|The \| character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====

Notice that the pipe character appears unescaped in the rendered result.

Escaping the cell separator character can be tedious.
There are also times when you can't or don't want to modify the content in the table cell.
To handle those cases, AsciiDoc allows you to override the cell separator.
The cell separator is controlled using the separator attribute on the table block.
You'll want to select a character that will never be used for content.
A good candidate is the broken bar, or `¦`.

Here's the previous example rewritten using a custom separator.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols=2*,separator=¦]
|====
¦The default separator in PSV tables is the | character.
¦The | character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====
----

Notice that it's no longer necessary to escape the pipe character in the content of the table cells.

=== Delimited-Separated Values

Tables can also be populated from data stored as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values[delimiter-separated values].
In contrast with the PSV format, in which the delimiter is placed in front of each cell value, in a delimiter-separated format, the delimiter is placed between the cell values as a _separator_.
Each line of data is assumed to represent a single row, though you'll learn that's not a strict rule.
How the data in a table gets interpreted is controlled by the `format` and `separator` attributes on the table.

.What the delimiter?
****
Are comma-separated values a subset of delimiter-separated values or something different?
Well, it kind of depends on who you ask.

The term "`delimiter-separated values`" in this text refers to the family of delimited data formats, including comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV) and delimited data (DSV), all of which are supported in AsciiDoc.
CSV is the data format encountered most often.

But "`comma-separated values`" is misleading since CSV can use a delimiter other than `,` as the field separator.
What we're really talking about is <<delimited-data-formats,how the data is interpeted>>.

CSV and TSV both use a delimiter and an optional enclosing character.
DSV (i.e., delimited data) only uses a delimiter (which can be escaped); an enclosing character is not recognized.
****

Let's consider an example of using comma-separated values (CSV) to populate a table with data.
To instruct the processor to read the data as CSV, you set the value of the `format` attribute on the table to `csv`.
When the `format` attribute is set to `csv`, the default data separator is a comma (`,`), as seen in the table below.

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=csv]
----

.Result: Rendered CSV table
[width=90%]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=csv]

This feature is particularly useful when you want to populate a table in your manuscript from data stored in a separate file.
You can do so using the <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> inside the table delimiters, as shown here:

[source]
----
[%header,format=csv]
|===
\include::tracks.csv[]
|===
----

If you're data is separated by tabs instead of commas, set the `format` to `tsv` (tab-separated values) instead.

Now let's consider an example of using delimited data (DSV) to populate a table with data.
To instruct the processor to read the data as CSV, set the value of the `format` attribute on the table to `dsv`.
When the `format` attribute is set to `dsv`, the default data separator is a comma (`,`), as seen in the table below.

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=dsv]
----

.Result: Rendered DSV table
[width=90%]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=dsv]

==== Delimited Data Formats

The CSV and TSV formats are parsed differently from the DSV format.
This section outlines those differences.

The CSV and TSV formats are parsed according to the following rules, loosely based on http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180]:

* The default delimiter for CSV is a comma (`,`) while the default delimiter for TSV is a tab.
* Blank lines are skipped (unless enclosed in a quoted value).
* Whitespace surrounding each value is stripped.
* Values can be enclosed in double quotes (`"`).
 ** A quoted value may contain the separator or newline character or double quotes.
 ** Although newlines in a quoted value should be retained, due to bug {uri-org}/asciidoctor/issues/2041[#2041], each one is converted to a single space.
* A double quote character can be used inside a quoted value if escaped using a double quote (`""`).
* If rows do not have the same number of cells ("`ragged`" tables), cells are shuffled to fully fill the rows.
 ** This is different behavior than Excel, which pads short rows with empty cells.
 ** As a rule of thumb, data for a single row should be on the same line.

The DSV format is parsed according to the following rules:

* The default delimiter for DSV is a colon (`:`).
* Blank lines are skipped.
* Whitespace surrounding each value is stripped.
* The delimiter character can be included in the value if escaped using a single backslash (`\:`).
* If rows do not have the same number of cells ("`ragged`" tables), cells are shuffled to fully fill the rows.

==== Custom Delimiters

Although each data format has a default separator associated with it, the separator can be changed to any character (or even a string of characters) by setting the `separator` attribute on the table.

Here's an example of a DSV table that uses a custom separator character (i.e., delimiter):

.A DSV table with a custom separator
[source]
----
[format=dsv,separator=;]
|===
a;b;c
d;e;f
|===
----

TIP: To make a TSV table, you can set the `format` attribute to `csv` and the separator to `\t`.
Though the `tsv` format is preferred.

The separator is independant of the processing rules for the format.
If you set `format=dsv` and `separator=,`, the data will be processed using the dsv rules, even though the data looks like CSV.

==== Table Format Shorthands

Asciidoctor provides shorthand notation for specifying the data format of a table.
The first position of the table block delimiter (i.e., `|===`) can be replaced by a built-in delimiter to set the table format (e.g., `,===` for CSV).

To make a CSV table, you can use `,===` as the table block delimiter:

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]
----

.Result: Rendered CSV table using shorthand syntax
[width=90%]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]

To make a DSV table, you can use `:===` as the table block delimiter:

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]
----

.Result: Rendered DSV table using shorthand syntax
[width=90%]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]

When using either the CSV or DSV shorthand, you do not need to set the `format` attribute as it's implied.

To make a TSV table, you can set the `format` attribute to `tsv` instead of having to set the `format` to `csv` and the separator to `\t`.
In this case, you can use either `|===` or `,===` as the table block delimiter.
There is no special delimited block notation for a TSV table.

==== Cell Formatting

The delimited formats do not provide a way to express formatting of individual table cells.
Instead, you can apply cell formatting to all cells in a given column using the `cols` spec on the table:

[source]
----
[format=csv,cols="1h,1a"]
|===
Sky,image::sky.jpg[]
Forest,image::forest.jpg[]
|===
----
