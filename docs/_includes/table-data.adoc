=== CSV and DSV Data Formats

Tables can be created from Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Delimiter Separated Values (DSV).
To use these type of datasets, set the `format` attribute and assign it the `csv` or `dsv` value.
Tables using these alternate data formats are structured and formatted exactly like `psv` tables, the data separators are just different.

When the format attribute is set to `csv`, the data separator is a comma (`,`), as seen in the table below.

When the format attribute is set to `dsv`, the data separator is a colon (`:`).

Asciidoctor also provides shorthand notation for setting CSV and DSV table formats.
The first position of the table block delimiter (i.e., `|===`) can be replaced by the data delimiter to set the table format.

Instead of specifying the CSV format using a block attribute, you can simply replace the leading pipe (`|`) with a comma (`,`):

include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]
----

.Result: Rendered CSV table using shorthand syntax
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]

In the same way, the DSV format can be specified by replacing the leading pipe (`|`) with a colon (`:`).

include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]
----

.Result: Rendered DSV table using shorthand syntax
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]

DSV and CSV datasets don't support individual cell formatting.
However, you can apply formatting, including the AsciiDoc style, to a column of cells using the column spec:

[source]
----
[cols="1h,1a"]
,===
Sky,image::sky.jpg[]
Forest,image::forest.jpg[]
,===
----

Keep in mind that CSV and DSV cell data does not preserve endlines, so it does limit what you can do with the AsciiDoc style.

DSV and CSV datasets can be inserted into a table using the <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>>.

----
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
\include::tracks.csv[]
|===
----

.Result: Rendered table of CSV data pulled from a separate file
[width="90"]
[format="csv", options="header"]
