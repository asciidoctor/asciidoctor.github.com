A table of contents (TOC) is a list of section and nested subsection titles that is generated when Asciidoctor processes a document.

To include a TOC, you must set the `toc` attribute.

The `toc` attribute can be specified via the command line (`-a toc`) or in the document's header (`:toc:`)

.TOC enabled via the CLI
----
$ asciidoctor -a toc adventure.adoc
----

.TOC enabled via the document's header
----
include::toc.adoc[]
----

With no other options set,
the TOC is inserted directly below the document's title and author, its title is _Table of Contents_, and it contains section 1 and section 2 level titles only.

.Result: Setting the toc attribute

Asciidoctor allows you to customize the layout, placement, and title of the table of contents.

[NOTE]
Only the html backend implements all of the customizations.
See <<table-of-contents-summary>> for what customizations are available in the other backends.
