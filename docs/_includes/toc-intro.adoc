A table of contents (TOC) is a list of section and nested subsection titles that is generated when Asciidoctor processes a document.

When the `docbook` converter is used, a TOC is inserted by default.
To include a TOC when using the `html` or a custom backend, you must set the `toc` attribute.
The toc attribute can be specified via the command line (`-a toc`) or in the document's header (`:toc:`)

.TOC enabled via the CLI
----
$ asciidoctor -a toc adventure.adoc
----

.TOC enabled via the document's header
----
include::toc.adoc[]
----

When the `toc` attribute is set with no other options,
The TOC is inserted directly below the document's title and author, titled _Table of Contents_, and lists the section 1 and section 2 level titles.

Asciidoctor provides additional attributes to customize the placement, layout and title of the table of contents.
