- user-manual: Using attributes: set, assign, and reference
////

Before you can use an attribute in your document, it must be *set*.
(Sometimes referred to as *toggling on*.)

Some attributes are set for you when {adr} processes a document.
Otherwise, you set an attribute by adding its name to the document:

 :sectnums: y

Many attributes can be assigned a *value* at the same time:

 :leveloffset: +3
 
// not sure what an operation is
The value can be a number, text, or an operation, but may not reference another attribute.

Attributes can be *unset* with the bang symbol (`!`).
The `!` can be placed before or after the attribute's name.

For example, both:

 :sectnums!:

and

 :!sectnums:

mean unset the `sectnums` attribute and therefore “do not number” the sections.

An attribute *reference* is the name of the attribute enclosed in curly brackets:

 The value of leveloffset is {leveloffset}
 
The reference is replaced by the attribute's value when Asciidoctor processes the document.
Referencing an attribute that is not set is considered an error, and will be handled specially by the processor.

The following sections will show you how to use attributes on your whole document, individual blocks, and inline elements.
