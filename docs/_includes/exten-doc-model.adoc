#This section is still under development. Dan Allen has knowledge about the document model and will develop this section further.#

Here's the current list of `content_model` values:

NOTE: Context names are unbounded. They merely instruct the processor which convert handler method to call.

* `:compound` - zero or more child blocks
* `:simple` - paragraph content
* `:verbatim` - literal content
* `:raw` - unprocessed content
* `:skip` - drop the content
* `:empty` - don't expect content (mostly relevant for macros)
* `:attributes` - parse as attributes (only relevant for macros)

Here's the current list of built-in structural containers (aka delimited blocks) that can support block extensions.
Each structural container is named by their default context:

* `:open` - --
* `:example` - ====
* `:sidebar` - {asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}
* `:literal` - ....
* `:listing` - ----
* `:quote` - ____
* `:pass` - {plus}{plus}{plus}{plus}
* `:paragraph`
