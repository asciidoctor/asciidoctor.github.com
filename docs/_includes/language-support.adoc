Asciidoctor defaults to English for built-in labels, messages and syntax keywords.
However, Asciidoctor is certainly not limited to working with English-only content.
Asciidoctor can process the full range of the UTF-8 character set.
That means you can write your document in any language and expect Asciidoctor to convert the text properly.
Furthermore, you can customize the built-in labels (e.g., "`Appendix`") to match the language in which you are writing.

There are some caveats to know about:

* Currently, the official HTML and PDF converters only fully support left-to-right (and top-to-bottom) reading.
Support for right-to-left (RTL) is being worked on.
See {uri-org}/asciidoctor/issues/1601[issue #1601] for details.
In the interim, you can leverage the DocBook toolchain to get right-to-left support.
* Attributes that store dates and times (e.g., `docdatetime`) are always formated like `2015-01-04 19:26:06 GMT+0000`.
* Message (aka logging) strings are always in English.
* Asciidoctor does not support the language conf files used by AsciiDoc Python.

=== Customizing built-in labels

If you're creating DocBook output, you can rely on the DocBook toolchain to translate (most) built-in labels.
To activate this feature, simply set the `lang` attribute to a valid country code (which defaults to `en` for English). 
For example:

----
$ asciidoctor -a lang=es -b docbook article.adoc
----

The list of supported languages, as well as additional language considerations for DocBook, are described in http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/Localizations.html[DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide].

When creating HTML or PDF (via Asciidoctor PDF), you must translate each built-in label yourself by setting the following attributes in the document header or via the API or CLI:

[cols="10,20,10",width="80%"]
|====
|Attribute name |Used for |Default

|appendix-caption
|Appendix titles.
|Appendix

|caution-caption
|CAUTION admonitions (when icons are not in use).
|Caution

|example-caption
|Example titles.
|Example

|figure-caption
|Automatically prefixed to figure titles.
|Figure

|important-caption
|IMPORTANT admonitions (when icons are not in use).
|Important

|last-update-label
|Label for when the document was last updated.
|Last updated

|listing-caption
|The label for listing blocks. 
By default, listing blocks do not have captions.
If you specify `listing-caption`, then you also turn on captions for listing blocks.
|_not set_

|manname-title
|Label for the program name section in the manpage.
|NAME

|note-caption
|NOTE admonitions (when icons are not in use).
|Note

|preface-title
|Title text used for the preamble (when the `doctype` is book).
|_not set_

|table-caption
|Automatically prefixed to table titles. 
|Table

|tip-caption
|TIP admonitions (when icons are not in use).
|Tip

|toc-title
|Title of the table of contents.
|Table of Contents

|untitled-label
|The document title, for documents that have only body content.
|Untitled

|version-label
|The label preceding the revnumber in the document's byline.
|Version

|warning-caption
|WARNING admonitions (when icons are not in use).
|Warning
|====

If you plan to support multiple languages, you'll want to define the attributes for each language inside a conditional preprocessor directive.
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\ifeval::["{lang}" == "de"]
:caution-caption: Achtung
...
\endif::[]
----

There's an ongoing discussion about how to make language support even simpler (link:{uri-org}/asciidoctor/issues/1129[issue #1129]).
Input is welome.

=== Translation

Asciidoctor (or DocBook) currently does not support translation out of the box.
There's a proposal to integrate gettext (link:{uri-mailinglist}/Professional-providers-translating-Asciidoc-tt2692.html#none[discussion]), but all suggestions are welcome.
