// == Importing from MicroSoft Word

=== Basic

Pandoc (http://pandoc.org) is a swiss army knife for converting file formats, and makes a good job of simple docx files. Use this command line:

 $ pandoc --wrap=none --atx-headers --normalize --extract-media=build/images input.docx > output.adoc

then edit the output file to tidy it up.

The conversions you can expect are shown in the table below (tested using Windows Pandoc 1.16.0.2).

=== Bulk Import

The basic usage above is fine for one-off imports.
If you have lots of documents to import, it is worth while massaging the input document first, and automating the tidy up.

// Is this egg sucking? I have just told the reader what is and isn't implemented, if he can drive Word he doesn't need me to tell him what to do.
// Are the comments helpful? Should they go into the text?

. Clean up the Word document:
// Title pages are usually easier to recreate manually
** Remove non-essential material (title pages, headers and footers, table of contents etc); it is usually easiest to copy just the body text into a new blank document
// Technically not necessary as Pandoc ignores them by default, but it simplifies the document, which is a good thing in principle
** Switch off tracking and accept all changes and 
// Important - Pandoc recognizes the style name to define headings
** Ensure you have used Heading styles for headings
// bug in 1.16.0.2
** Remove automatic heading numbering (this limitation may be removed in the next release of Pandoc)
// So you can turn them back into captions just with a .
** Ensure table titles are immediately *above* their table
// So you can turn them back into captions just with a .
** Ensure figure titles are immediately *above* their figure
// linked images are ignored (according to my testing)
** Ensure images are inserted as embedded files, not as links
// canvases are ignored (according to my testing)
** Remove canvases and put any images they contained into the main flow as paragraph images (this limitation may be removed in the next release of pandoc)
// results of SEQ formulas are ignored (MS Word uses these to generate figure and table numbers)
** Replace all internal references and auto-generated sequence numbers with their literal values (ctrl-a, ctrl-shift-F9)
// No - this will turn manually applied list formating back to plain text. Fine if you have used a list style though.
// * Remove all non style-based formating (ctrl-a, ctrl-space, ctrl-q)
// Back to plain text.
** Remove all character formating (ctrl-a, ctrl-i, ctrl-i, ctrl-b, ctrl-b)
// text boxes are ignored (according to my testing)
** Remove text boxes and put their text into the main flow
// pandoc just treats them as plain text as passes them through.
** Optional: insert ids and cross references using AsciiDoc notation
(You might find it quicker doing it now rather than in the AsciiDoc document later.)
// Not sure if it is significant, but pandoc seems to be designed against this spec, rather than the normal docx.
** Save it as "Strict Open-xml document (docx)"
. Convert using Pandoc as above
. Check that the output document looks OK, and that the folder of images is complete.
If some images are missing, don't worry - you can extract them using a zip program (see the Ant fragments below).
. Fix up the output, preferably with an editor that can do regular expressions:
// tocs and cross refs introduce dozens of these. They are just noise.
* Delete anything that looks like
+
 [[_*]]
+ 
// Not sure about this - they dont show properly on PSPad, but look fine when converted to HTML.
* Replace smart quotes with simple ones.
// Style issue - pandoc seems to extend the line to cover the longest row
* Replace long table delimiters with short ones.
// Style issue
* Insert line-breaks to get to 1 sentence per paragraph.
// can do this with a regexp, but is depends on exactly what format you used for them
* Re-insert images and turn caption paragraphs back into {adr} captions.
// can do this with a regexp, but is depends on exactly what format you used for them
* Replace the hard cross references with AsciiDoc references.
// checked vertical merge, assume h merge same
* Fix tables - merged cells will have unmerged, column widths need putting back.
. Try to convert it, and fix any errors that come up.
// pandoc supposedly only uses UTF-8, and the xml file is windows encoded, but I haven't found any problems so far.
// You definitely do get encoding errors if you go via HTML.
+
NOTE: Using this route, there _shouldn't_ be any encoding errors.
If there are, use the Ant `nativetoascii` task to make them visible as \NNNN codes.

These Ant task fragments automate some of these steps.

Extract image files:

docx is just a zip file with a docx file extension.
The images are always in the same place.

// Gets images from canvases as well, but not vector graphics
[source,xml]
----
<unzip src="${infile}" dest="build"/>
<copy todir="dist/images">
  <fileset dir="build/word/media"/>
</copy>
----

Run Pandoc:

[source,xml]
----
<exec executable="pandoc">
    <arg value="-f"/><arg value="docx"/>
    <arg value="-t"/><arg value="asciidoc"/>  
    <arg value="--wrap=none"/>
    <arg value="--atx-headers"/>
    <arg value="--normalize"/>
    <arg value="-o"/><arg value="${outfile}"/>
    <arg value="${infile}"/>
</exec>
----

Automate some of the editing steps (you will need to adjust the regexps to match your particular document):

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Delete automatically inserted ids -->
<replaceregexp
    file="${outfile}" 
    match="\[\[_.*]]"
    replace=""
    flags="g"/>

<!-- Shorten table delimiters -->
<replaceregexp
    file="${outfile}"
    match="\|==*"
    replace="|===="
    flags="g"/>

<!-- 1 sentence per line. Be careful not to match lists. It will get confused by abbreviations, but there is no way around that. -->
<replaceregexp
    file="${outfile}"
    match="(\w\w+)\.\s+(\w)"
    replace="\1.${line.separator}\2"
    flags="g"
    byline="true"/>

<!-- Replace figure captions with id and title -->
<replaceregexp
    file="@{outfile}"
    match="^Figure (\d?)*\s?(.*)"
    replace="[[fig-\1]]${line.separator}.\2${line.separator}"
    byline="true"/>

<!-- Replace references to figures with asciidoc xref -->
<replaceregexp
    file="@{outfile}"
    match="Figure (\d?)"
    replace="&lt;&lt;fig-\1&gt;&gt;"
    flags="g"/>
----

=== Other Conversion Routes

// actually this is pretty good: you need a few more edits after, but it picks up text boxes, 
// leaves heading numbers in so you can reconstruct cross references, and substitutes special characters.
// The only real pain is tables which are converted to plain paragraphs, and images.

If you don't have pandoc, save as MS-Dos text (no line breaks), and insert the AsciiDoc syntax manually.
