=== Styling the HTML with CSS

This document is included in render-documents and the user-manual. 
////

Asciidoctor uses CSS for HTML document styling and JavaScript for generating document attributes such as a table of contents and footnotes.
It comes bundled with a fresh, modern stylesheet, named +asciidoctor.css+.
When you generate a document with the +html5+ backend, the +asciidoctor.css+ stylesheet is embedded into the HTML output by default.

However, you can link to the stylesheet instead of embedding it.
To have your document link to the default stylesheet, set the +linkcss+ attribute in the document's header.

----
include::mysample-link.adoc[]
----

You can also set +linkcss+ with the CLI.

 $> asciidoctor -a linkcss mysample.adoc
 
Now, when you view the directory, you should see the file +asciidoctor.css+ in addition to +mysample.adoc+ and +mysample.html+.
The +linkcss+ attribute automatically copies +asciidoctor.css+ to the output directory.
Additionally, you can inspect +mysample.html+ in your browser and see +<link rel="stylesheet" href="./asciidoctor.css">+ inside the +<head>+ tags.

If you don't want any styles applied to the HTML output of your document, unset the +stylesheet+ attribute.

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesheet! mysample.adoc

One of Asciidoctor's strengths is the ease in which you can swap the default stylesheet for your own custom stylesheet or alternative Asciidoctor themes.

If you want to apply your own stylesheet to the rendered HTML, using the CLI:

. Save your custom stylesheet in the same directory as +mysample.adoc+
. Call the +asciidoctor+ processor
. Add the +stylesheet+ attribute with +-a+ (+--attribute+)
. Include the stylesheet file's name

//end

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesheet=mystyles.css mysample.adoc
 
Alternatively, let's set the +stylesheet+ attribute in the header of +mysample.adoc+.

----
include::mysample-stylesheet.adoc[]
----

====
image::mysample-stylesheet.png[]
====

Stylesheets can also be stored in a directory other than the directory where your document is saved; you just need to tell Asciidoctor where to look for them using the +stylesdir+ attribute.
Let's store the +mystyles.css+ stylesheet in +mydocuments/mystylesheets/+.
Our AsciiDoc document, +mysample.adoc+, is saved in the +mydocuments/+ directory.

----
include::mysample-stylesdir.adoc[]
----

When you process +mysample.adoc+, the HTML output (+mysample.html+) is saved in the +mydocuments/+ directory.
 
====
image::mysample-stylesdir-dir.png[]
====

You can also set +stylesdir+ in the CLI.

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesdir=mystylesheets/ -a stylesheet=mystyles.css mysample.adoc

If you don't want to embed the +mystyles.css+ stylesheet into your HTML output, make sure to set +linkcss+.

----
include::mysample-stylesdir-link.adoc[]
----

After your document is rendered, notice that a copy of +mystyles.css+ was not created in the +mydocuments/+ directory.
Unlike when you link to the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, any custom stylesheets you link to are not copied to the directory where your output is saved.

CAUTION: The +copycss+ attribute, which would copy a custom stylesheet when a document is rendered, is broken.
