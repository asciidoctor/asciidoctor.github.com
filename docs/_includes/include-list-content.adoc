To use the include directive with content as part of an existing line requires a small trick.
The `include` directive must be on "it's own" line.
However the list item must have some content to be recognized as a list item.
To achieve this we use the `\{blank}` built in attribute (see <<complex-list-content>> for another example of this) to give the list item some content.

So to have an `include` add content to a numbered list item we can use:

[source,asciidoc]
----
. {blank}
\include::item-text.adoc[]
----

That's great for including a single line or lines which are adjacent.
Lists require that multiple lines are adjacent, so if you have <<complex-list-content, complex list content>> in your included file, you need a little more.
You need to wrap it in an <<open-blocks,open block>> and connect it with the existing line using a <<list-continuation,list continuation>> (a `+`).
