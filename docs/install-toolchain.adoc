// A new introduction that introduces and ties together all the elements in the chain (installing gem, text editors, previewer) needs to be created eventually.

Asciidoctor, an implementation of the AsciiDoc processor written in Ruby, is a drop-in replacement for AsciiDoc in most cases.
Asciidoctor provides both a command-line tool and a Ruby API for converting AsciiDoc documents to HTML 5, DocBook 4.5 and custom output formats.

However, if you wish to convert your document to PDF and a few other formats, you'll still need to install the AsciiDoc processor.

== Installing AsciiDoc

The original {asciidocreadme}[AsciiDoc processor] is a Python script and can be run on any system that has Python 2 installed.footnote:[At the time of writing, the AsciiDoc processor does not work with Python 3.]

=== Package management systems

The quickest way to install AsciiDoc is through the package manager on your system.
Here are the commands for several popular package management systems:

.Fedora

 sudo yum -y install asciidoc
 
.Ubuntu / Debian

 sudo apt-get install asciidoc

.MacOSX

 brew install asciidoc

NOTE: If Python isn't already installed, it should be installed as a dependency of the package.

If the install was successful, you should be able to execute the +asciidoc+ and +a2x+ commands from a command prompt:

 $> asciidoc --version
 asciidoc 8.6.8
 $> a2x --version
 a2x 8.6.8

=== Manually

If you can't get the AsciiDoc processor using a package manager, you can install it manually following these steps:

. Make sure you have Python 2 installed on your system
. http://sourceforge.net/projects/asciidoc/files/latest/download[Download the distribution archive] from the AsciiDoc website.
. Extract the archive into a directory where you keep your programs
. Find the +asciidoc.py+ and +a2x.py+ files in the extracted directory
. Rename these files to +asciidoc+ and +a2x+, respectively
. Add the extracted directory to your PATH environment variable

For more details on the manual install, see the {asciidocinstall}[AsciiDoc Installation Guide].

If the install was successful, you should be able to execute the +asciidoc+ and +a2x+ commands from a command prompt:

 $> asciidoc --version
 asciidoc 8.6.8
 $> a2x --version
 a2x 8.6.8

== Installing Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor is published as a RubyGem.
It currently works with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.3, Ruby 2.0.0, JRuby 1.7.2 and Rubinius 1.2.4 on Linux, Mac and
Windows.

If you have Ruby on your system, you can install Asciidoctor using the +gem+ command:

 $> gem install asciidoctor

If the +asciidoctor+ gem installed successfully, the +asciidoctor+ command-line interface should be available on your PATH. 
To invoke it, simply execute:

 $> asciidoctor --version
 Asciidoctor 0.1.1 [http://asciidoctor.org]

=== +yum+ package manager

If you are running Fedora 17 or higher, you can install it using +yum+, which will also install Ruby if it's not yet installed on your system.

 $> sudo yum install rubygem-asciidoctor

Now you're ready to convert your AsciiDoc document to a variety of formats!

== Text editors and syntax highlighting

Since AsciiDoc syntax is just +plain+ +text+, you can write an AsciiDoc document using _any_ text editor.
You don't need complex word processing programs like Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer or Google Docs.
In fact, you shouldn't use these programs because they add cruft to your document (that you can't see) and makes conversion tedious.

TIP: While it's true any text editor will do, an editor that supports syntax highlighting for AsciiDoc may be more helpful.
The *[red]##c##[green]##o##[purple]##l##[fuchsia]##o##[blue]##r##* brings contrast to the text, making it easier to read.
The highlighting also confirms when you've entered the correct syntax for an inline or block element.

The most popular application for editing plain text on Mac OS X is *TextMate*.
A similar choice on Linux is *GEdit*.
On Windows, stay away from Notepad and Wordpad because they produce plain text which is not cross-platform friendly.
Opt instead for a competent text editor like *Notepad++*.
If you're a programmer (or a writer with an inner geek), you'll likely prefer *Vim*, *Emacs*, or *Sublime Text*, all of which are available cross-platform.
The key feature all these editors share is http://asciidoc.org/#_editor_support[syntax highlighting for AsciiDoc].

TIP: Previewing the output of the document while editing can be helpful.
To learn how to setup instant preview, check out the {preview}[Editing AsciiDoc with Live Preview] tutorial.

Open up your favorite text editor and get ready to write some AsciiDoc!
