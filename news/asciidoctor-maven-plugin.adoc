I'd like to introduce you to the easiest way to use AsciiDoc from Maven: the asciidoctor-maven-plugin! It's simple to run and provides a great integration for projects looking to use AsciiDoc for authoring documentation, or any other part of this project utilizing AsciiDoc.

Information about usage and setup can be found in the {gh-repo}(asciidoctor-maven-plugin GitHub repo). This plugin will track Asciidoctor. Its version number should match the core project's version, unless an interim fix needs to be made which will then be a mico-micro bump.

We're always open for patches, better documentation, feature requests, evangelizing or any help you're able to provide.
