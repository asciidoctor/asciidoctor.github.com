I'd like to introduce you to the easiest way to use AsciiDoc from maven: The asciidoctor-maven-plugin! It's very simple to get up running and provides a great integration for projects looking to use AsciiDoc for authoring documentation, or any other part of this project utilizing AsciiDoc.

Information about usage and setup can be found at {gh-repo}(the GitHub repo). This plugin will track Asciidoctor and should be versioned the same as the core project, unless there's an interim fix that needs to be made which will then be a mico-micro bump.

We're always open for patches, better documentation, feature requests, evangelizing or any other help you're able to provide.
