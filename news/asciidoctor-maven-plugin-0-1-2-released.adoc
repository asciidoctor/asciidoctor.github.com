Following the tradition of quick updates shortly after the release of core Asciidoctor, I'd like to announce the 0.1.2 release of the
Apache Maven plugin! It contains all of the options the asciidoctor-java-integration (fixed in version 0.1.1.1 also released today) supports!
This should be a simple upgrade for users, simply updating the version. All needed dependencies should be pulled in via Maven.

For more information about issues fixed in this release please see the {https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/issues?milestone=3&state=closed}[0.1.2 Milestone]!
