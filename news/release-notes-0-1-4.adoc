=== Checklists

Unordered lists can support a checkbox marker. 
The checkbox has two states: checked and unchecked. 
By default, the checkboxes are interactive, but they can be marked as +readonly+ using an option.

.Interactive

[ ] not checked
[*] checked
----

.Read-only
----
[options="readonly"]
[ ] not checked
[*] checked

=== CLI accepts and processes multiple source files

The Asciidoctor CLI accepts multiple source files and processes them in a loop.

For the example below, let's assume there are two AsciiDoc files in your directory.
When you enter the following command in your terminal:

 > asciidoctor *.adoc

The shell will expand it to:

 > asciidoctor file1.adoc file2.adoc

Asciidoctor will process each of the files passed in as arguments. 
It is the same as running the +asciidoctor+ command on each file separately.

You can also render all the AsciiDoc files in your current folder and any subfolders.

 > asciidoctor **/*.adoc

Resolves {issue-ref}/227[227]

=== Pre-wrap literal blocks and nowrap option

Stylesheets should support pre-wrap and word-wrap: break-word;

Currently, the AsciiDoctor style is configured to respect pre-formatted lines and prevent any word wrapping. This is fine in theory, however in practice it frequently means that content overflows the browser window and causes scrolling, which is a far greater readability problem than wrapping.

There are two camps on this preference and neither setting will please both. That points to making this an option. The default of no-wrap complies with the behavior of AsciiDoc (which attempt to mimic for credibility). However, I definitely want to accommodate this preference / use case.

The most obvious and AsciiDoc-like way to provide this customization is to add an "option" for wrapping (in the same way that options are used to set strong text, compact list items, etc).

[source, java, options="wrap"]
----
public class ApplicationConfigurationProvider extends HttpConfigurationProvider
{
   @Override
   public Configuration getConfiguration(ServletContext context)
   {
      return ConfigurationBuilder.begin()
               .addRule()
               .when(Direction.isInbound().and(Path.matches("/{path}")))
               .perform(Log.message(Level.INFO, "Client requested path: {path}"))
               .where("path").matches(".*");
   }
}
----

With Asciidoctor, the options can be abbreviated as:

[source, java, opts=wrap]
Since this is a setting you likely want to apply globally, I'm considering an attribute such as:

:prewrap:

I realized that the behavior of AsciiDoc is the opposite, pre-wrap is used by default. Therefore, we'll make that the default in Asciidoctor and require options="nowrap" (or role="nowrap") for the nowrap class to be added. Specifying this option will output:

<pre class="nowrap">

in addition to any other class that is emitted.

Excellent, don't forget that break-word is also required for this to function properly!

Yep, I added both. I think it make sense to use them as a pair, hence the
attribute only refers to "wrap" in a general sense (i.e., just do the right
thing)

=== Additional numbering styles for ordered lists

Asciidoctor supports lowergreek and decimal-leading-zero numeration for ordered lists. 
Additional numeration styles can be implemented using a custom role (i.e., style class). 

*TODO: In the code it looks like all of these styles are supported, or are some of them still custom?*

Style options are now as follows:

* arabic (equivalent to decimal)
* decimal (equivalent to decimal-leading-zero)
* loweralpha (equivalent to lower-alpha)
* upperalpha (equivalent to upper-alpha)
* lowerroman (equivalent to lower-roman)
* upperroman (equivalent to upper-roman)
* lowergreek (equivalent to lower-greek)

(the "equivalent to" refers to the value of the list-style-type CSS property)

*TODO: I don't understand what the 'equivalent to' means or if it is relevant to users/documentation?*

Arabic and decimal are aliases.
The keyword decimal refers to the decimal-leading-zero numeration style.

*TODO: Example code showing how to use one of these styles and table/list of each option's name and with sample of what it looks like*

Resolves {issue-ref}/364[364] 

=== Custom markers for unordered lists

An unordered list marker can be represented as a:

* square
* circle
* disc
* no-bullet (equivalent to none)

*TODO: Example code showing how to use one of these styles and table/list of each option's name and with sample of what it looks like*

These styles are supported by the default stylesheet.

Resolves {issue-ref}/364[364] 

=== If +linkcss+ is not set, the CodeRay stylesheet will be embedded

The CodeRay stylesheet is embedded in a document only when the +linkcss+ attribute is *not* set.
If +linkcss+ is set, the CodeRay stylesheet or a user specified alternative coderay.css stylesheet will be linked to the document.
The +copycss+ attribute also copies the CodeRay stylesheet to coderay.css next to the default Asciidoctor stylesheet.

Resolves {issue-ref}/381[381]

*TODO: Might combine this update with the update regarding the stylesheet default setting change*

=== Enable the table header row implicitly

After adding shorthand syntax for table format in Asciidoctor 0.1.3, it seemed tedious to include the +[options="header"]+ block attribute line above a table in order to enable the header row.

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces the following rule set that allows the writer to enable the table header row implicitly.

. The first line of content inside the table block delimiters is non-empty.
. The second line of content inside the table block delimiters is empty.
. The options attribute has not been assigned.
. If these are all true, then enable the header option on the table.

The table header row will be enabled implicitly in the example below.

----
|===
|Col A |Col B |Col C

|Value 1
|Value 2
|Value 3

|Value 4
|Value 5
|Value 6
|===
----

.Output 
|===
|Col A |Col B |Col C

|Value 1
|Value 2
|Value 3

|Value 4
|Value 5
|Value 6
|===

*TODO: Did the method below get implemented?*

I haven't decided whether we should allow the table header row to be enabled in this scenario, because it requires a lot more forward seeking:

[rows="3"]
|===
|Col A
|Col B
|Col C

|Value 1
|Value 2
|Value 3

|Value 4
|Value 5
|Value 6

=== Template engine option for the CLI

The template engine option in the API (i.e., +:template_engine+) is now mapped as an option in the CLI.

 --template-engine

or

 -E

This option is used for resolving the location of a collection of backend templates.
For example, if you execute:

 > asciidoctor -b html5 -T asciidoctor-backends -E slim
 
Asciidoctor will look for templates in the directory [file]_asciidoctor-backends/slim/html5_.

=== DocBook 5.0 Backend

*TODO: Command needed*
*What's different between it and the 4.5 backend that may cause confusion/problems for users?*

Resolves {issue-ref}/411[411]

=== Text enclosed in backticks supports the role assignment

Like other enclosed text in AsciiDoc, text enclosed in backticks allows a role to be assigned.

Given:

 [rolename]`escaped text`
 
The following HTML is produced:

 <code class="rolename">escaped text</code>
 
This makes the behavior of backticks consistent with other forms of enclosed text in Asciidoctor.

Resolves {issue-ref}/419[419]

=== Style attribute moved to instance variable on AbstractBlock

Style attributes apply to nearly every block, so it made sense to add them as an instance variable on AbstractBlock.

As a result of this change, templates can be simplified from:

 if (attr :style, nil, false) == 'abstract'

to:

 if @style == 'abstract'
 
AbstractNode convenience methods for +role?+, +role+, +reftext?+ and +reftext+ were also added to further simplify template creation.

*TODO: Example code showing how to use these styles and table/list of each styles's name and function*

Resolves {issue-ref}/436[436]

=== Specify multiple custom template directories

Custom templates no longer need to be stored in the same directory.
Now, you can build on another custom backend without copying its templates into a new directory. 
Just specify the template directory of the original backend, followed by the template directory containing your overrides and customizations.

In the CLI, multiple directories are supplied using the +-T+ option multiple times (thus, there is no need for a +--template-dirs+ argument).

*TODO: Commandline example showing how to use +-T+ as well as any common commands that are typically used with it and caveats (i.e. you can't also use +template_engine+*

Resolves {issue-ref}/437[437]

////

The template_dir option in the API should accommodate an array of strings in addition to a string value. 

1. Does the template engine stuff need to be included?

NOTE: When multiple template directories are specified, the +template_engine+ option no longer applies (mutually exclusive).  

As it turns out, we don't have to forbid the use of template_engine when using multiple template directories. 
Asciidoctor will just look for a folder matching the template engine in each template directory (the same logic that's applied when only one template directory is provided).

2. Does the information Alex provided need to be included in documentation somewhere and/or in this changelog?

@lordofthejars Note that this is a change to the options. Asciidoctor first looks for :template_dir and, if present, wraps it in an array and assigns it to :template_dirs. If :template_dir is absent, Asciidoctor then looks for template_dirs and expects it to be an Array. The best approach in the fluent API is to allow templateDir to be specified multiple times, and also add a templateDirs method which appends to that running list. Then, just pass the :template_dirs to Asciidoctor.

////

=== Cache backend templates

*TODO: What is the benefit of caching?*

*TODO: Where should this be documented (technical?/API manual?*

*TODO: Example code showing how to explicitly disabled it or how a replacement cache can be passed in via the options.

*TODO: Was the option named +template_cache+?

If Asciidoctor is invoked multiple times within the same Ruby process using the same set of custom (Tilt-based) templates, those templates should not be loaded more than once.

This problem can be solved in two ways. 
In the absence of any configuration, the cache can be maintained internally. 
The cache should be partitioned such that the same template name in different backends should be separate keys.

It should also be possible to supply an instance of the cache as an option to the Asciidoctor API. 
That way, it's possible for the client application to control the cache (duration, size, etc) and flush it at will.

A proposed option name for the supplied cache is +template_cache+.

I've observed that Haml seems to have an internal cache of templates its already loaded, whereas Slim seems to read the same template each time it's requested. 
We can probably look at what Haml is doing and clone that. 
There is also a very primitive cache example in Tilt (TiltCache).

I think the global built-in cache should be enabled by default. 
It can either be explicitly disabled or a replacement cache can be passed in via the options.

=== Import a file from a URI using the include macro

The include macro can import a file from a URI.

IMPORTANT: The +:allow-uri-read:+ attribute must be set in the API or CLI (not document) in order to include content form a URI.
The attribute is disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.

Example:

Resolves {issue-ref}/445[445]

*TODO: Does the caching thing need to be mentioned? And if so, will need example for documentation.

Caching is strongly recommended. To enable the built-in cache:

* install the open-uri-cached gem
* pass the cache-uri attribute

=== +html-pipeline+ source-highlighter

The source-highlighter option +html-pipeline+, which prepares source code listing blocks to be processed by +jch/html-pipeline+, is now available.

=== +showtitle+ is an alias for +notitle!+

The +notitle!+ attribute allows the document title to be included in the rendered document when the header and footer are disabled (i.e., embedded). 
However, the double negative is confusing for users. 
Now, the attribute +showtitle+ can be used instead of +notitle!+.

Resolves {issue-ref}/457[457]

=== Image styles: float, thumbnail, and related 

For block images, you can use the float attribute (+float="left"+ or +float="right"+) or the position in the role (+role="left"+ or +role="right"+). 
In both cases, a margin is added above the image and ~10px between the image and text.

For inline images, you can use the position in the role (+role="left"+ or +role="right"+).
Margins are added above and below the image and ~10px between the image and text.

Styles to emulate the look of a thumbnail (+role="th"+ or +role="thumb"+) have also been included.

Here's an example of how to make an inline image look like a thumbnail and float to the right of the text:

 image:foo.png[role="related thumb right"] Here is the text that will be to the left.

The related role isn't technically required, but recommended for semantic reasons.

Here's an example of how to make a block image look like a thumbnail and float to the right of the next block (e.g., paragraph):

----
.An image title
image::foo.png[role="thumb right"]

Text in next paragraph.
----

In the example above, +float="right", role="thumb"+ would also work.

A margin attribute was not introduced because it mixes very specific presentation information with content, which AsciiDoc works hard to keep separated. 
The proper way to style an element is to assign it a role (or an extra role) and provide a stylesheet that contains styles for that role.*

If you want to customize the image styles, you can provide your own stylesheet additions (either by using your own stylesheet that builds on the default stylesheet or adding them in a docinfo file).

* The float attribute walks a fine line here.

WARNING: The shorthand syntax for a role (+.+) can not yet be used with image styles.

=== Include images by full URL

For lightweight/instant publishing to HTML it would be useful to include images by full URL. 
This way the user can point to images located on different services, a blog, clipart, whatever, without having to care about downloading the images and putting them in a specific location.

Here's an example use case:
http://docgist.nawroth.se/

Here, the page is rendered by the browser using asciidoctor.js from a source document stored as a GitHub gist. 
I added post-processing to turn links to images into images. 
But I'd prefer a distinct syntax in AsciiDoc for this.

The original use case for this is http://gist.neo4j.org/ but I created the above version where there's no additional Neo4j related stuff. At Neo4j, we want to be able to (as well as enable users to) quickly publish database queries with some surrounding text. Let's say I want a UML diagram on the page, then I use http://yuml.me/ to create it. That gives me an image URL I can use right away, no need to download it and upload it to somewhere.

Dan Allen

Thanks for posting this feature request!

Could you provide the syntax you would expect to be able to type to insert an image? I can then build from there, either by looking at how to use features in Asciidoctor currently or introducing a new one. Some actual syntax examples will go a long way here.

Anders Nawroth

The main question is whether we should extend the image or link syntax or even create a new one.

Extending the image syntax seems logical but I find it ugly:

image:http://example.com/images/logo.png["Company Logo",height=32]
Extending the link (or actually http/https/file) syntax along the same lines as markdown looks more smooth:

!http://example.com/images/logo.png["Company Logo"]
But then, setting img attributes on a link may come as a surprise:

!http://example.com/images/logo.png["Company Logo",height=32]
Or you could take it for a link if you don't look carefully.

In the end, having full URLs instead of file refs in the existing image syntax (ignoring the imagesdir attribute in that case) seems to be the path of least surprise. Explicit is better.

For similar use cases (but with all images at a single location), setting the imagesdir attribute to an URL sounds very useful.

Dan Allen 

Oh no, don't suggest that horrible Markdown image syntax. The horror!

First, I'm noticing that you've found a compliance bug in Asciidoctor. The first example should create an image. It does with AsciiDoc. It does not with Asciidoctor. What's strange is that it works in the block image macro (notice the double colon):

image::http://example.com/images/logo.png["Company Logo",height=32]
Asciidoctor already supports detecting a URL target so it doesn't add imagesdir to the front of the path. That works in the block macro case.

:imagesdir: ./images

image::http://example.com/images/logo.png["Company Logo",height=32]
Produces:

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://example.com/images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
</div>
</div>
Thus, what I think this bug is about is fixing the compliance issue w/ the inline image macro (to recognize a URL target) and to update the asciidoc.conf compatibility file to get AsciiDoc to detect a URL target and not add the imagesdir prefix (which Asciidoctor already does correctly).

And, of course, if you want to avoid typing the URL prefix on all links, you can just do:

:imagesdir: http://example.com/images

image:logo.png["Company Logo", height=32]

The open question I'm left with is whether we need two prefixes, imagesdir and imagesdir-remote, then have some way to indicate that the image macro should use one or the other. Perhaps if the target begins with a forward slash, and imagesdir-remote is set, then the target is treated as a URL path (rather than a local file path). WDYT?

=== Non-selectable callout bullets in listings

In previous versions of Asciidoctor, when a reader selected and copied source code from listing with callouts, the callout numbers got caught in the text selection. 
If the reader then tried to use or run the code, the extra characters probably caused errors.

In Asciidoctor 0.1.4, callout numbers will be removed from the text selector when line comments are used in front of the number.

----
line of code      // <1>
line of code       # <2>

Resolves {issue-ref}/478[478]

=== Style options shorthand

Normally, block options are specified using the +options+ attribute.
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 allows block options to be specified with the percent sign symbol (+%+).

Consider a table block with three options. 

.Traditional AsciiDoc syntax
----
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
| Cell A | Cell B

----

Here's how the options are written using the shorthand notation (+%+).

----

=== Docinfo option for footer

Docinfo files allow authors to include arbitrary content in the header of a rendered document (HTML or DocBook). 
Now, docinfo files can be used for including content in the footer.

The "footer docinfo" files are named with the suffix `-footer`. 
For example, `docinfo-footer.(html|xml)` or `docname-footer.(html|xml)`.

Resolves {issue-ref}/486[486]

=== Attributes for handling missing and undefined references

By default, the original AsciiDoc processor drops a line if it contains a reference to a missing attribute.
A dropped line may not be what the user wants or expects. 
It's also frustrating since it may not be immediately apparent to the writer, editor, or other readers that a line is missing until a full read-through of the text is done.

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces two attributes to alleviate this inconvenience: +attribute-missing+ and +attribute-undefined+.

+Attribute-missing+ has three ways to handle missing references:

* +skip+ - leave the reference in place (default)
* +drop+ - drop the reference, but not the line
* +drop-line+ - drop the line on which the reference occurs

Consider the following declaration:

----
 :attribute-missing: drop
----

This reads as:

 "When an attribute is missing, drop the reference to it."

+Attribute-undefined+ is used when an attribute is undefined (i.e., unassigned). 
Consider the following declaration:

----
{set:name!}
----

In this case, we never want the skip behavior, because this is a directive, not output. 

The possible values for +attribute-undefined+ are:

* +drop+ - substitute the directive with an empty string after processing it
* +drop-line+ - drop the line on which this directive (default)

*TODO: the sentence above doesn't make sense*

By default, this attribute is set to +drop-line+, which is standard AsciiDoc behavior.

Resolves {issue-ref}/495[495], {issue-ref}/523[523]

=== +!+ before an attribute name undefines the attribute

AsciiDoc uses the convention of a +!+ at the end of an attribute name to undefine the attribute. 

 :numbered!:

However, this may read as "numbered not". 
Now, the +!+ can also be placed at the beginning of the attribute name to undefine it.

 :!numbered:

This reads as "not numbered", which is more consistent with programming conventions.

When used on the commandline, the leading +!+ is misinterpretted by the shell as a command. 
However, this is easily solved by quoting (or escaping) the argument value. 

For example:

 -a '!numbered'

or

 -a \!numbered

Resolves {issue-ref}/498[498]

=== Ignore front matter

Commonly used in static site generators, front matter typically starts on the first line of a file and is marked by a delimited block (+---+).
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 treats front matter as comment lines and ignores it. 

Example:

----
---
layout: default <1>
---
= Document Title

content
----
<1> The Asciidoctor processor will ignore this front matter.

Resolves {issue-ref}/502[502]

////
TODO: So what attribute name did you decide to use? How do you use it
TODO: Example code
Which docs should this be added to?

From issue:
We should probably have a means of enabling this feature, since it's distinctly non-standard. Perhaps we can name the attribute skip-front-matter.

Should we capture the front matter into the attribute front-matter? What about for include files?
   
I think that this attribute is really necessary to extend the use cases where AsciiDoc format can be used. For example you can bake all project documentation (Manual, Design, Requirements, ...) using Awestruct so all members of the team can check, but at the same time if you need to provide that documentation to any regulatory office then you can render it and submit it without any problem, simply skipping the Awestruct header part.

=== Strip HTML tags from doctitle when rendering HTML title element

AsciiDoc uses the document title (i.e., +doctitle+ attribute) to populate the HTML title element in the HTML backend. 
It also permits inline formatting in the +doctitle+; however, the HTML title element must be plain text. 
The HTML backend will strip HTML elements (but not the containing content) from the doctitle before inserting it into the HTML title element.

Example:

AsciiDoc document:

 = *Document* _Title_
 
As rendered currently:

 <title><strong>Document</strong> <em>Title</em></title>
 
Expected:

 <title>Document Title</title>
 
Note that a workaround is to define the title attribute on the document, which is used in place of the doctitle in the HTML title element.

Example:

----
= *Document* _Title_
:title: Document Title
----

The HTML 5.1 specification drafts state that the title element is require and it must not be empty. Therefore, I've introduced "Untitled" as the default value, retrieved from the untitled-label document attribute.

TODO: Was the issue below addressed?

From Issue: The open question is where to put this shorthand in inline macros. Putting it within the square brackets already present makes the most sense, but the attribute position is not as clear cut as it was with delimited blocks. That may need to be addressed in a separate issue.
////

=== Insert icons inline

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces an inline macro for inserting an icon at an arbitrary place in paragraph content. 

Here's an example that inserts a tags icon in front of a list of tag names:

 icon:tags[] ruby, docs

Here's how this example renders in the HTML backed when the +icons=font+ attribute is set:

```html
<div class="paragraph">
<p><i class="icon-tags"></i> ruby, docs</p>
</div>
```

Here's how it renders in the HTML backend when the +icons+ attribute is not set or empty:

```html
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="./images/icons/tags.png" alt="tags"></span> ruby, docs</p>
</div>
```

Here's how it renders in the DocBook backend, regardless of the +icons+ attribute value:

````xml
<inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="./images/icons/tags.png"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>tags</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject> ruby, docs
````

### Relationship to the inline image macro

The inline icon macro is similar to the inline image macro with a few exceptions:

* If the `icons` attribute has the value `font`, the macro will translate to a font-based icon in the HTML backend (e.g., `<i class="icon-tags"></i>`)
* If the `icons` attribute does not have the value `font`, or the backend is DocBook, the macro will insert an image into the document that resolves to a file in the `iconsdir` directory (e.g., `<img src="./images/icons/tags.png">`)

The file resolution strategy when using image-based icons is the same used to locate images for the admonition icons. The file extension is set using the `icontype` attribute, which defaults to `png`.

### Icon sets

At the moment, the font-based icon set is assumed to be [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome). You can see the possible icon name options on the [icons page](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) page. Support for other icon sets is being discussed in issue #539.

When you aren't using font-based icons, or you are using the DocBook backend, the icon set is only limited by which icons you have in your `iconsdir` directory.

### Customizing the icon

The icon macro has a few attributes that can be used to modify the size and orientation of the icon. At the moment, these are specific to Font Awesome and therefore only apply to HTML output when icon fonts are enabled.

* size (first positional attribute) - scales the icon; possible values: large, 2x, 4x
* rotate - rotates the icon: possible values: 90, 180, 270
* flip - flips the icon: possible values: horizontal, vertical

The first unnamed attribute is assumed to be the size. For instance, to make the icon twice the size as the default, simply add `2x` inside the square brackets.

    icon:heart[2x]

This is equivalent to:

    icon:heart[size=2x]

The previous example emits the following HTML:

    <i class="icon-heart icon-2x"></i>

To rotate and flip the icon, specify these options using attributes:

    icon:shield[rotate=90, flip=vertical]

The previous example emits the following HTML:

   <i class="icon-shield icon-rotate-90 icon-flip-vertical"></i>

NOTE: This markup is subject to change. In particular, the `<i>` element may be replaced with the `<span>` element.

### Additional metadata

Like an inline image, it's possible to add additional metadata to an inline icon.

Below are the possible attributes that apply to both font-based and image-based icons:

* link - The URI target used for the icon, which will be rendered as a link
* window - The target window of the link (when the `link` attribute is specified) (HTML backend)

Here's an example of an icon rendered as a link:

    icon:download[link="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"]

The previous example emits the following HTML:

    <a class="image" href="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"><i class="icon-download"></i></a>

Below are the possible attributes that apply in the case that font-based icons are *not* in use:

* alt - The alternate text on the `<img>` tag (HTML backend) or text for `<inlinemediaobject>` (DocBook backend)
* width - The width applied to the image
* height - The height applied to the image
* title - The title of the image displayed when the mouse hovers over it (HTML backend)
* role - The role applied to the element that surrounds the icon

Currently, the inline icon macro doesn't support any options to change it's physical position (such as alignment left or right).

=== Printing warning and error messages

Asciidoctor has replaced +puts+ with +warn+.
+Warn+ directs error and warning messages to $stderr. 
This is important because it prevents the messages from being displayed in the rendered document when piped to another command.

The +warn+ method prints messages to $stderr, which can be disabled in the script or when Ruby is invoked by passing +-W0+. 
The +asciidoctor+ command does not yet have a command flag to disable these messages.

=== Incrementing section numbers

AsciiDoc allows section numbering to be toggled on and off throughout a document using the attributes +:numbered:+ and +:numbered!:+, respectively.

For regions of the document where section numbering is turned off, the section numbering will not be incremented.

Given:

----
= Document Title

:numbered!:

== Colophon Section

== Another Colophon Section

== Last Colophon Section

:numbered:

== Section One

== Section Two

== Section Three
----

The sections will be numbered as follows:

----
Colophon Section

Another Colophon Section

Last Colophon Section

1. Section One

2. Section Two

3. Section Three
----

Asciidoctor will always curtail incrementing the section number in regions of the document where section numbers are off.

If +numbered+ is set on the commandline (or API), that overrides the value set in the document header, but it does not prevent the document from toggling the value for regions of the document.

If +numbered!+ is set on the commandline (or API), then the numbers are disabled regardless of toggling within the document.

=== Substitute attributes in docinfo files

Attributes are substituted in docinfo files before including the content into the output.

With the following document:

:doctype: book
:backend: docbook
:docinfo:
Then the output should be:

=== Escaping the attributes that precede formatted text does not disable formatting

If the attributes that precede formatted text are escaped (using a leading backslash), the text will still be formatted and the attributes treated as plain text.

Given:

 Try to click a [disabled]\+button+.

The HTML output is:

 Try to click a [disabled]<code>button</code>.

Notice that text is still rendered as monospaced (inside a <code> element), but the attributes (which define the role) have been ignored and treated as plain text.

=== Embed CSS by default, +copycss+ when +linkcss+ is set

In Asciidoctor 0.1.4, the standard stylesheet is automatically embedded.
By embedding the stylesheet by default, the user does not need to worry about linking to (+linkcss+) the stylesheet or copying (+copycss+) it to the output folder.
Additionally, when the user prefers to link to the stylesheet by setting +linkcss+, the stylesheet will be copied (via +copycss+) automatically to the output folder.

=== TOC double numbering eliminated

The TOC in the HTML5 backend is now output as an unordered list instead of an ordered list. 
This eliminates the chance of the double numbering problem (native list numbering and section numbering), even in the absence of a stylesheet.
It also removes the need to use +type="none"+ on +<ol>+.

=== Percentage column widths

Instead of taking the percent widths verbatim (like AsciiDoc), Asciidoctor strips the % sign and calculates the percentage based on relative numbers. 
Otherwise, you can end up with percentages that don't add up to 100%, which is technically broken HTML.

Here are some examples:

----
Input: 10%,90%
Output:

<colgroup>
<col style="width:10%;">
<col style="width:90%;"> 
</colgroup>
----

----
Input: 10%,10%

<col style="width:50%;">

=== Manpage metadata

Asciidoctor parses the manpage metadata, including:

* mantitle
* manvolnum
* manname
* manpurpose

The +mantitle+ and +manvolum+ are parsed from the document title. 
The +manname+ and +manpurpose+ are taken from the first section of the document, which must be a level 1 section and have content in the format <manname> - <manpurpose>.

For example, the following input:

----
= asciidoctor(1)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
asciidoctor - converts AsciiDoc source files...

== SYNOPSIS
*asciidoctor* ['OPTION']... 'FILE'...
----

Produces these variables:

mantitle: asciidoctor
manvolnum: 1
manname: asciidoctor
manpurpose: converts AsciiDoc source files...

=== Allow Java::JavaUtil::Map for attributes option type in load API

The type check on the attributes option in the Asciidoctor load API was too restrictive as it did not accommodate a Java Map (Java::JavaUtil::Map). 
This broke the Java integration in 0.1.3.

In Asciidoctor 0.1.4, the type check on the attributes option was relaxed in two ways:

. It checks if the type is a Java::JavaUtil::Map when the RUBY_ENGINE is jruby
. It allows any type that responds to "has_key?" as that's likely a Hash-like object

See asciidoctor/asciidoctor-java-integration#50 for further reference.

=== Write to specified outfile when the input is stdin

The Asciidoctor cli command does not write to the specified file if the input is stdin.

=== Callout marks not substituted when sourcecode-highlighter=coderay

When the `source-highlighter` attribute is set to `coderay`, the callout marks in the source block. This happens because CodeRay wraps the callout mark, preventing it from being matched by the callout match expression.

Example:

```
:source-highlighter: coderay

[source,java]
----
public class Document { <1>
}
----
<1> class definition
```

I found a way to strip the callout marks before passing the source code to the CodeRay highlighter, then restore them to their previous locations after highlighting is complete. This hides them from CodeRay entirely so it doesn't get confused, but preserves the requirement that they appear at the end of the line of code in the AsciiDoc source.

Here's how the example above is rendered in HTML (which is the only output in which CodeRay gets used):

```html
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content monospaced">
<pre class="CodeRay"><code class="java language-java"><span class="directive">public</span> <span class="type">class</span> <span class="class">Document</span> { <b>(1)</b>
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>class definition</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
```

Notice the `<b>(1)</b>` at the end of the long line.

Also, the callouts must be at the end of the line of source code.

=== Open blocks and paragraphs styled as comment are too greedy

Open blocks and paragraphs that have the "comment" style are consuming lines well beyond the terminator. Add tests for these scenarios and fix the parser to stop capturing lines at the proper termination of the block.

Examples:

Open block comment
```
[comment]
--
skip

this block
--

not this text
```

Paragraph comment
```
[comment]
skip
this paragraph

not this text
```

Paragraph comment adjacent to block

=== Create a page that lists / recommends editors (#81)

People are often asking which editor they should use for AsciiDoc (phrased as "what's a good AsciiDoc editor?"). Of course, our stance is that you don't need a special editor. We can make that point, but also recommend editors that have good syntax highlighting and perhaps embedded preview.

We want to make sure to recommend open source options first, but I guess it would be biased if we didn't list non-open source editors that are know to be very good (such as Sublime).

=== Write documentation for how to create a custom backend (#80)

Write documentation for how to create a custom backend. Information to be covered includes:
