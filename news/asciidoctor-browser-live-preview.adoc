I'd like to introduce you to the easiest way to render any AsciiDoc file, local or remote, as HTML directly in your browser!

All you need to do is install the {download-chrome-extension}[Chrome extension] or the {download-ff-addon}[Firefox add-on]. That's all.

== How it works

The Chrome extension and the Firefox add-on use {gh-adjs-repo}[Asciidoctor.js] to render AsciiDoc as HTML inside your browser.
Both provide a toggle button to switch between HTML output and AsciiDoc source.

== Future

Currently, we are using {gh-adjs-repo}[Asciidoctor.js] based on {gh-ad-repo}[Asciidoctor] 0.1.2.
We planned to cross-compile the newly-released {gh-ad-repo}[Asciidoctor] 0.1.4 to Javascript, to support the latest and greatest features!

We are also working on adding some cool new features :

 * browser-based editor using {markitup-site}[MarkItUp!]
 * live reload to automatically refresh on local file changes
 * and many more...

== Contributing

We're always open for patches, better documentation, feature requests, evangelizing or any help you're able to provide.
