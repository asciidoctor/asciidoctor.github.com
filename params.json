You can override this behavior by providing Tilt-compatible templates.\r\n\r\nAsciidoctor currently works with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.3 and JRuby 1.7.1, though we don't know of any reason it shouldn't work with more exotic Ruby versions and welcome help in testing them.\r\n\r\nThe initial code from which Asciidoctor started was from the Git SCM site repo.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nAsciidoctor only has a single dependency at the moment:\r\n\r\n* tilt\r\n\r\nWhile we aim to keep dependencies to a minimum, we do expect others to be added.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the gem:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install asciidoctor\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you prefer bundler:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install asciidoctor\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo render a file containing AsciiDoc markup to an HTML file:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nlines = File.readlines('your_file.asciidoc')\r\ndoc = Asciidoctor::Document.new(lines)\r\nhtml = doc.render\r\nFile.open('your_file.html', 'w+') do |file|\r\n  file.puts html\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo render an AsciiDoc-formatted string:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndoc = Asciidoctor::Document.new(\"*This* is it.\")\r\nputs doc.render\r\n```\r\n\r\nAsciidoctor allows you to override the built-in templates used to render almost any individual AsciiDoc element. If you provide a directory of Tilt-compatible templates, named in such a way that Asciidoctor can figure out which template goes with which element, Asciidoctor will use the templates in this directory instead of its built-in templates for any elements for which it finds a matching template. It will fallback to its default templates for everything else.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndoc = Asciidoctor::Document.new(\"*This* is it.\", :template_dir => 'templates')\r\nputs doc.render\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Document and Section templates should begin with `document.` and `section.`, respectively. The file extension is used by Tilt to determine which view framework it will use to use to render the template. For instance, if you want to write the template in ERB, you'd name these two templates `document.html.erb` and `section.html.erb`. To use Haml, you'd name them `document.html.haml` and `section.html.haml`.\r\n\r\nTemplates for block elements, like a Paragraph or Sidebar, would begin with `block_<style>.`. For instance, to override the default Paragraph template with an ERB template, put a file named `block_paragraph.html.erb` in the template directory you pass to the `Document` constructor using the `template_dir` option.\r\n\r\nFor more usage examples, see the test suite.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of free software, _everyone_ is encouraged to help improve this project.\r\n\r\n* **Source repository:** http://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor\r\n* **API documentation:** http://asciidoctor.org/rdoc\r\n\r\nHere are some ways **you** can contribute:\r\n\r\n* by using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions\r\n* by reporting bugs\r\n* by suggesting new features\r\n* by writing or editing documentation\r\n* by writing specifications\r\n* by writing code - _No patch is too small._\r\n  * fix typos\r\n  * add comments\r\n  * clean up inconsistent whitespace\r\n  * etc.\r\n* by refactoring code\r\n* by fixing issues\r\n* by reviewing patches\r\n\r\n## Submitting an Issue\r\n\r\nWe use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues?state=open) associated with the Asciidoctor project on GitHub to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a Gist that includes any details that may help reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, since Asciidoctor is a text processor, reproducing most bugs requires that we have some snippet of text on which Asciidoctor exhibits the bad behavior.\r\n\r\nAn ideal bug report would include a pull request with failing specs.\r\n\r\n## Submitting a Pull Request\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repository.\r\n2. Create a topic branch.\r\n3. Add tests for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.\r\n4. Run `bundle exec rake`. If your tests pass, return to step 3.\r\n5. Implement your feature or bug fix.\r\n6. Run `bundle exec rake`. If your tests fail, return to step 5.\r\n7. Add documentation for your feature or bug fix.\r\n8. If your changes are not 100% documented, go back to step 7.\r\n9. Add, commit, and push your changes.\r\n10. Submit a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Supported Ruby Versions\r\n\r\nThis library aims to support the following Ruby implementations:\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.8.7\r\n* Ruby 1.9.3\r\n* JRuby 1.7.1\r\n\r\nThe library is tested against each of these versions using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor).\r\n\r\nIf something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Ryan Waldron.\r\nSee LICENSE for details."}
